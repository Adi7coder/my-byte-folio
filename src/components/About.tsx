      title: 'Beyond the Code',
      content: `Outside academics, I draw energy and creativity from wildlife photography, painting, and public speaking. 
      Photography sharpens my observational skills, painting sparks artistic insight, and public speaking enhances my 
      articulation and leadership presence. These passions empower me to think laterally and connect across disciplines.`

      book reading, and habit tracking to ensure I'm progressing intentionally. I keep a close watch on my fitness, 
      nutrition, sleep, and productivity, minimizing distractions like social media to stay focused.

      Currently, I'm also actively involved with the CPA (Centre for Performing Arts) at DSU and DSU Student Affairs, 
      where I contribute to cultural and student engagement initiatives. These roles, combined with my disciplined habits, 
      reflect my commitment to personal leadership, self-improvement, and purposeful contribution.`

      or offering exceptional value to the organization I serve. I believe in pairing curiosity with consistency, 
      and knowledge with execution, to make an enduring impact.`
